            <p class="greeting">Hey, thanks for checking out my page!</p>
            <p>
              I am a mostly
              <span class="no-wrap">self-taught</span> developer with about
              three years of experience writing code in various languages;
              JavaScript being my main. I enjoy coming up with creative
              solutions to challenging problems and I love learning new things,
              so programming has served as a major source of joy and mental
              stimulation for me over the last couple of years. In 2022, I fully
              intend of turning this hobby of mine into my next career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote my first program six years ago as an undergraduate student
              at the University of North Carolina. While there, I took several
              courses that covered topics such as object-oriented programming
              (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and computer architecture.
              After taking these courses, I wasn't fully convinced that Computer
              Science was the path for me so I decided to step away from
              programming so that I could focus on pursuing a career in
              education.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018, I accepted an offer to teach 8th grade math in my
              hometown of Bloomfield, CT and, like any job, teaching had its ups
              and downs. I loved sharing my knowledge with groups of curious
              students and being someone's favorite teacher is such a huge honor
              but after my second year in that position, it became clear to me
              that I was not being challenged anymore and I had stopped growing
              as a professional. So in mid-2020, I decided to resume learning
              how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I am confident that I have the tools necessary to be
              successful in an entry-level role. I've created a few projects
              which you can see in the Projects section that showcase what I
              have learned and how much I have grown in the past year.
            </p>

              I took a few Computer Science courses in college but took a break
              from programming to focus on a career in education. After three
              years of teaching, I am looking for an opportunity to work
              alongside brilliant developers and take on some new and exciting
              challenges.

                  >. It started out as an ordinary HTML/CSS/JS app but I was
                  really struggling with the organization of my code. All of my
                  styles were in the same stylesheet and all of my functions
                  were in the same JavaScript file, so debugging this was kind
                  of a nightmare. But when I learned about React and the idea of
                  separating code into components, I thought that converting
                  this to a React project would help me solve the problem I was
                  having. And it did for the most part. Now that I have a bit
                  more experience, I realize that I definitely could've created
                  this without React but I'm still proud of what I learned. And
                  for my first project, I think it turned out pretty well. This
                  was a good challenge.

                  This is the first project I made that uses data from an API. I
                  got the inspiration for this project from
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"

                  >
                  video on YouTube. They use the free
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php"
                    >MealDB API</a
                  >
                  in their video so I searched for other free data I could use
                  and found the
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php"
                    >CocktailDB API</a
                  >. This is a super simple project but this is the one that got
                  me over my irrational fear of APIs. And this is the project
                  that made me curious about back-end technologies and
                  frameworks, which took my skills to all new heights.

                  This is my first full-stack project and it was inspired by my
                  time as a teacher. During that time, I used several
                  educational technologies to enhance my lessons and while they
                  were all great in their own unique ways, I often found myself
                  wishing that there was just one app that had everything I
                  wanted. I wanted something with large, adaptive problem sets
                  like the ones on IXL, with articles and videos like Khan
                  Academy, and a chat feature like Google Classroom. So I made
                  one with the help of John Smilga aka Coding Addict's
                  <a
                    target="_blank"

                    >Node.js course</a
                  >. <br /><br />
                  This app tested me. Along with the technologies I mentioned
                  above and John Smilga's incredible video lessons, I spent
                  many, many, many hours reading documentation and implementing
                  other packages in this project before I found a few I really
                  liked. I even had to reach out to other devs on GitHub and on
                  Twitter from help from time to time, which really took me out
                  of my confort zone.
