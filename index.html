              I am a
              <span class="no-wrap">self-taught</span> developer with three
              years of experience writing code in various languages; JavaScript
              being my main. As someone who enjoys challenges and learning new
              things, programming has served as a major source of joy for me
              over the last two years. In 2022, I fully intend on turning this
              hobby into my next career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote my first program six years ago as an undergraduate student
              at the University of North Carolina. While there, I took several
              courses that covered topics such as object-oriented programming
              (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and computer architecture.
              After taking these courses, I wasn't fully convinced that Computer
              Science was the path for me and I pursued a career in education
              instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018, I accepted an offer to teach 8th grade math in my
              hometown of Bloomfield, CT and, like any job, teaching had its ups
              and downs. I loved sharing my knowledge with groups of curious
              students and being someone's favorite teacher is such a huge
              honor. However, after two years in that position it became clear
              to me that I was no longer being challenged and that I had stopped
              growing as a professional. It was this realization that made me
              decide to resume my coding journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I am confident that I have the tools necessary to be
              successful in an entry-level role. I've created a few projects
              which you can see in the My Work section that showcase what I have
              learned and how much I have grown in the past year.

              I took a few Computer Science courses in college but took a break
              from programming to focus on a career in education. After three
              years of teaching, I am looking for an opportunity to work
              alongside brilliant developers and take on some new and exciting
              challenges.

                  >. It started out as an ordinary HTML/CSS/JS app but I was
                  really struggling with the organization of my code. All of my
                  styles were in the same stylesheet, all of my functions were
                  in the same JavaScript file, and debugging this was a
                  nightmare. But when I learned about React and the idea of
                  separating code into components, I thought that converting
                  this to a React project would help me solve the problem I was
                  having. And it did for the most part. Now that I have a bit
                  more experience, I realize that I definitely could've created
                  this without React but I'm still proud of what I learned. And
                  for my first project, I think it turned out pretty well.

                  This is the first project I made that uses data from an API. I
                  got the inspiration for this project from
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"

                  video on YouTube. They use the free
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php"
                    >MealDB API</a
                  >
                  in their video which motivated me to search for free data I
                  could use. The
                  <a
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php"
                    >CocktailDB API</a
                  >
                  is just as user-friendly as the MealDB API but it's
                  different-enough that I didn't feel like I was simply copying
                  the tutorial. <br /><br />
                  Fun fact: Although it doesn't look like much, this is the
                  project that got me over my irrational fear of APIs. It's also
                  partially responsible for me wanting to learn more about
                  back-end technologies and frameworks.

                  This is my first full-stack project and it was inspired by my
                  time as a teacher. During that time, I used several
                  educational technologies to enhance my lessons and while they
                  were all great in their own unique ways, I often found myself
                  wishing that there was just one app that had everything I
                  wanted. I wanted something with large, adaptive problem sets
                  like the ones on IXL, with articles and videos like Khan
                  Academy, and a chat feature like Google Classroom. With the
                  help of John Smilga aka Coding Addict's
                  <a
                    target="_blank"

                    >Node.js course</a
                  >, I brought that idea to life. <br /><br />
                  This app tested me. Along with the technologies I mentioned
                  above and John Smilga's incredible video lessons, I spent
                  many, many, many hours reading documentation and implementing
                  other packages in this project before I found a few I really
                  liked. I even had to reach out to other developers on GitHub
                  and on Twitter for help from time to time, which really took
                  me out of my comfort zone.
