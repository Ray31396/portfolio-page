            <p class="greeting">Hey, thanks for checking out my page!</p>
            <p>
              I am a mostly
              <span class="no-wrap">self-taught</span> developer with about
              three years of experience writing code in various languages;
              JavaScript being my main. I enjoy coming up with creative
              solutions to challenging problems and I love learning new things,
              so programming has been a major source of joy and mental
              stimulation for me over the last couple of years. In 2022, I fully
              intend of turning this hobby of mine into my next career.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote my first program six years ago as an undergraduate student
              at the University of North Carolina. While there, I took several
              courses that covered topics such as object-oriented programming
              (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and computer architecture.
              After taking these courses, I wasn't fully convinced that Computer
              Science was the path for me so I decided to step away from
              programming so that I could focus on pursuing a career in
              education.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018, I accepted an offer to teach 8th grade math in my
              hometown of Bloomfield, CT and, like any job, teaching had its ups
              and downs. I loved sharing my knowledge with groups of curious
              students and being someone's favorite teacher is such a huge honor
              but after my second year in that position, it became clear to me
              that I was not being challenged anymore and I had stopped growing
              as a professional. So in mid-2020, I decided to resume learning
              how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I am confident that I have the tools necessary to be
              successful in an entry-level role. I've created a few projects
              which you can see in the Projects section that showcase what I
              have learned and how much I have grown in the past year.
            </p>

              I did some coding in college but took a break and decided to
              pursue a career in education instead. After three of teaching, I
              am looking for an opportunity to work alongside brilliant
              developers and take on some new challenges. Here's what I've been
              up to:
