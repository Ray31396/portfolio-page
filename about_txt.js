  "I am a motivated, (mostly) self-taught developer eager to land my first " +
  "tech job. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill " +
  "in 2018 with a major in Mathematics and almost enough credits for a Computer " +
  "Science minor. My original plan was to major in both but I had to make the " +
  "difficult decision of dropping CS so that I could focus on building towards a " +
  "career teaching math in my hometown. This choice left me feeling a bit empty " +
  "and unsatisfied but having the chance to work alongside some of my past teachers " +
  "while educating young minds in my community was an opportunity I knew I could " +
  "not pass up. So, I pursued a career in education and made a promise to myself to " +
  "continue learning code.</p><br/>" +
  "<p>And that is exactly what I did. Between all the lesson planning, " +
  " grading, and periods of emotional eating, I learned code. " +
  "I started my self-taught journey with Java because that was the language " +
  "with which I was the most familiar and from there, I experimented with a " +
  "few other languages before ultimately falling in love with Javascript " +
  "and its range of uses. " +
  "For me, Javascript was the language that made everything click and " +
  "the differences between front-end and back-end technologies became crystal " +
  "clear.</p><br/> " +
  "<p>Once I was comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, I " +
  "began diving into Javascript libraries and frameworks, such as React.js, " +
  "Node.js, and Express.js to build more robust and functional web applications, " +
  "while focusing on keeping my codebases clean, readable and reusable. I am " +
  "proud of the progress I have made thus far and excited to see where " +
  "this path takes me.</p><br/> " +
  // "<p>After spending the last three years in education, I am ready to switch " +
  // "things up. I enjoyed my time in the field and learned many great skills " +
  // "that I hope to use in my next role. , but I feel like I've seen " +
  // "it all and done it all, and I would love a new challenge and a fresh start. " +
  "<p>Thank you so much for stopping by and be sure to take a look at what I have " +
  "been working on in the section below. </p><br/> <p><span class='sig'>-RG</span></p>";
